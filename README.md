# AP Physics Mech A Extra Credit

![](demo.gif)
This is an extra credit assignment I designed for my AP Physics class at HBHS. Its made of 1000 3D rigid bodies textured as boxes.  

# Design

So my AP Physics teacher assigned an extra credit assignment to do a flip book related to physics.  I don't have any artistic ability, so I decided to use the game engine ![https://https://godotengine.org/](Godot) and set up a physics related scene. 
This scene consists of 1000 rigid bodies stacked up in a tower formation and uses the Bullet Physics engine to simulate physics.  To start the scene, I roll a granite ball toward the tower, which causes it to collapse.

Using OBS Studio, I recorded and made a video, which I then converted to GIF and then uploaded to gifprint.com to convert it to a PDF flipbook.

After doing all this work, I realize it might have just been easier to hand draw 100 pages of a flip book animation. Oh well, it's done!


### Credits

  - My dad for the idea and original starting code.
  - Brackeys for the nice wooden box textures.
  - Mr. DeWilde for being a cool AP Physics teacher!
  - Mr. Crossett for helping me become a better programmer.
